UNF 	(PatientNumber,PatientName,Birthdate,PrescriptionNumber,Medicine,Dosage,DoctorNumber,Doctor,Assistant)
1NF 	database is already in 1NF
	candidate keys: PatientNumber, PrescriptionNumber, DoctorNumber

	desc: Primary keys selected based on numerical relevance.
	PatientNumber refers to data regarding PatientName and their Birthdate
	PrescriptionNumber is linked to PatientNumber, as it is specific per patient, but also lilnked to Medecine
	and the corresponding dosage required.
	DoctorNumber is related to the doctor and the assistant that works with them
	Database is already in 1NF, as it contains distinct field names, likely to contain atomic values.

2NF	(PatientNumber,PrescriptionNumber, Medecin, Dosage, DoctorNumber)
	(PatientNumber,PatientName,Birthdate)
	(PrescriptionNumber, Medecine, Dosage)
	(DoctorNumber, Doctor, Assistant)

	desc: Partial dependency is removed.
	PatientNumber is kept in the main table, but will link to a seperate table containing information on patient (name and birthdate)
	Patient details do not share any relation with doctor or the medicine/dosage itself, that's why these are also split up in 
	separate tables.

3NF	(PatientNumber,PrescriptionNumber,Medecine_ID,Dosage,DoctorNumber)
	(PatientNumber,PatientName,Birthdate)
	(PrescriptionNumber, Medecine_ID, Dosage)
	(Medecine_ID, Medecine)
	(DoctorNumber, Doctor, Assistant_ID)
	(Assistant_ID, Assistant)

	desc: Transitive dependency is removed as a doctor can have several assistants, therefore, an extra table was created, regarding
	the Assistant_ID and Assistant. If this were to be kept in 1 table, Assistant would've relied on Assistant_ID and not on the
	primary key.
	Medecine was also split into Medecine and Medecine_ID, as different types of medication can be assigned to different individuals,
	resulting in the requirement of an identifier and type of medication. Dosage however was kept under the Prescription table,
	as different dosages may apply to the medication administrated and is dependent on the presciption number, hinting to both dose 
	and medication used.
